betaferon is formulated to contain 03 mg 96 million iu of interferon beta1b per vial at a calculated overfill of 20
an abnormal response by the bodyÂ’s immune system is thought to play an important part in the process which damages the cns
interferon beta1b has been shown to modify the immune system response
name and address of the holder of the marketing authorisation manufacturer
betaferon is indicated for use in ambulatory patients patients who can walk with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis ms characterized by at least two attacks of neurologic dysfunction over a two year period followed by complete or incomplete recovery
in this patient population betaferon was shown to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical relapses to reduce the number of ms related hospitalizations and to prolong the relapsefree time
there is no evidence of an effect of betaferon on the length of attacks symptoms in between attacks or the progression of the disease
therefore if you have such problems your kidney function should be monitored during treatment
however since serious adverse reactions to interferon betalb in breastfed infants are theoretically possible you should discuss the mater with your doctor and make a decision whether breastfeeding or betaferon should be stopped 
caution should be exercised when interferon beta1b is administered in combination with other drugs which need a certain liver enzyme system known as cytochrome p450 system for their metabolism
these drugs include some widely used antipyretics drugs against fever and pain oral contraceptives and antiepileptics
before administration the betaferon solution for injection has to be prepared from a vial of betaferon and 12 ml of liquid from a vial of diluent
this will either be done by your doctor or his/her assistant or by yourself after you have been carefully and sufficiently instructed and trained
one injection every 24 h instead of one injection every 48 h you should consult your doctor
therefore a differential white blood count and determination of serum chemistry sgot sgpt should be obtained prior to treatment and repeated regularly during the therapy
the following instructions are intended to explain how to prepare betaferon for administration and how to proceed in injecting betaferon yourself
do not attempt selfadministration until you are sure that you understand the requirements for preparing the injection solution and giving the injection to yourself
