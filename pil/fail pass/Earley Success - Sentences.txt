the instructions comprise the following main steps
preparing for selfinjection
drawing up the diluent sodium chloride solution into the syringe
injecting the required volume of diluent 12 ml into the vial of betaferon
drawing up the required volume of the solution for injection 10 ml into the syringe
preparing for selfinjection
collect
 all your equipment before you begin the process
you will need
vial of diluent for betaferonsodium chloride solution 054
vial of betaferon
2ml syringe

only the vial of diluent liquid that comes inside your prescription package should be used to dissolve the white powder in the betaferon vial
resting your hands on a stable surface
remove
 the syringe from its wrapping
do not touch the tip nozzle of the syringe
take the 21gauge needle out of its wrapping and place it firmly
remove
 the needle guard from the needle
do not touch the needle
pull back
note read the label on the vials  find the diluent vial and throw away the alcohol wipe on top of it
holding the vial of diluent on a stable surface slowly insert the needle straight through the rubber stopper into the top of the vial
if you touch a stopper clean it with a fresh alcohol b wipe
if you touch a needle or the tip nozzle of the  syringe throw it away into the disposal unit and start with a new one
if the needle touches any surface throw it away into the disposal unit and start with a new one

injecting the required volume of diluent 12 ml into the vial of betaferon
 note find the betaferon vial and throw away the alcohol wipe on top of it
holding the betaferon vial on a stable surface slowly
insert
 the needle of the syringe containing 12 ml of liquid all the way through the stopper of the vial
push the plunger down slowly
directing
 the needle toward the side of the vial to allow the liquid to run down the inside wall injecting diluent directly onto the powder will cause excess foaming
